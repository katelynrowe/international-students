plane and into the fluorescent lights of Concourse B. </p>

			<p>She’d been in the air for more than fifteen hours, had turned back the clock twelve time zones 
to get here.</p>

			<p>The sky was black now, and the floor-to-ceiling windows of Indianapolis International 
Airport revealed nothing more than reflections: reflections of closed kiosks and tourist shops, 
rows of empty gray chairs, late-night travelers like herself shuffling toward the baggage 
claim.</p>

			<p>“Empty,” she’d later call the feeling. Lonely. America felt unfamiliar, foreign, uncomfortable. Her friends weren’t by her side. Her parents were more than 7,000 miles and the width of an ocean away from her.</p>
			
			<p>Su pulled 150 pounds of her belongings — three suitcases — off of the carousel, then waited for a one-way shuttle to take her somewhere she’d never been before.</p>
			
			<p>Until today, Indiana University had only been a number on a list, staged pictures on a website, endless application papers and Visa forms.</p>

			<p>It was 2 a.m. She was alone.</p>

			<p>Su isn’t the only one who walked off a plane and didn’t find anyone waiting for her after she cleared customs.</p>
			
			<p>Other international students like her took the same lonely journey across the world, the same dark shuttle ride to the same unknown town in the middle of Indiana.</p>

			<p>These students were thrust into an environment completely foreign to them, and, having arrived on campus weeks earlier than domestic students, automatically gravitated toward familiar faces and languages for comfort.</p>

			<p>What this fosters, though, isn’t a culturally integrated IU campus. Chinese students still get sidelong looks from local students on buses when they speak Mandarin to one another. People stare when girls hold hands walking down the street — an everyday symbol of friendship in their home country.</p>

			<p>The first time Su got on a Bloomington bus, she didn’t know how to get off at her stop until someone else pulled the cord.</p>


			<p>Out of 3,737 undergraduate international students at IU-Bloomington, 2,084 are Chinese. They come from all over the 3.7 million square mile country, but they have one thing in common: before they enrolled as freshmen at the Bloomington campus, they’d never lived in the United States before.</p>

			<p>While a dissonance continues to exist between Chinese and domestic students, campus seems to stay quiet about discrimination and the tension that cultivates between cultural groups. While American students go to football games, look forward to seeing their families on the weekends and engage in the college culture of drunken Friday nights, international students are trying to find the time to FaceTime with their parents in spite of a 14-hour time difference. They’re figuring out where to go when they’re kicked out of the dorms for school breaks. They’re too unsure of their English skills to speak up in class — they’re quiet.</p>

			<p>But quiet doesn’t mean invisible.</p>

			<p>Su Li hardly speaks English outside of class, but she flirts with the cultural line that many international students never attempt to cross. She makes an effort to improve her English, and to become a part of IU culture, but still prefers card games with her Chinese friends to frat parties on the weekends despite living in one of the most infamous party dorms on campus. </p>

			<p>Their first week together, Su convinced her American roommate to join her in an IU-sponsored foam party outside of McNutt. It sounded like people were having fun, so why not?</p>

			<p>It was new to Su, this environment. Why did strangers keep trying to dance with her? Why were strangers acting like they knew her?</p>

			<p>“They’re just drunk,” Yanni explained.</p>

			<p>“I was thinking, ‘American girls are so open,’” Su said, laughing.</p>

			<p>Yanni made it out with mud-splattered legs, because Su convinced her not to wear her rain boots — an unforgotten piece of advice that hasn’t been forgiven to this day.</p>
	
			<p>Su lost a sandal that she never found again.</p>

		<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7 body-copy">		
			<p>Su grew up in the entirely different environment of Suqian, China, just outside of Shanghai, an only child to two parents. She knew fourteen-hour school days, large lectures where she wasn’t permitted to speak and two hours of piano practice from ages six to twelve. Her playing posture is still perfect.</p>

			<p>She always knew that she loved music, even though her parents pushed her. She was singing in primary school and reached the highest possible skill level for the piano by the time she was in fifth grade.</p>

			<p>When she saw Lady Gaga performing “Born This Way” on TV one day, she was hooked. That was her moment.</p>

			<p>She told her parents that she wanted to be a musician; they told her it wasn’t a lucrative job. She settled for music and arts management, though her major is still undecided.</p>

			<p>She didn’t know American culture, but applying to American schools was what all of her classmates did to ensure better futures. When it was time to pick universities to apply to her senior year, she ran through a school-generated list of colleges that were a likely match for her based on her SAT and TOEFL scores.</p>

			<p>Her eyes wandered, passing Syracuse and other East Coast schools.</p>

			<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Su moved into Foster the night of August 6, nobody was there to help. It was quiet, and the quad was dark.</p>

			<p>Empty.</p>

			<p>Suddenly there was nobody closeby who Su could go to for comfort. Home was so different from this, and so far away. She would only see her family through screens for a year, unable to fly to China for short vacations. She was displaced: for Thanksgiving, for Spring Break. Her family was still trying to figure out if they could afford a ticket home for the winter holiday.</p>

			<p>Su lined up her three suitcases at the bottom of the staircase and lugged them up the flight of stairs to the first floor, one by one. In China, the first floor meant the ground floor — she hadn’t anticipated stairs at all when she learned her room assignment.</p>

			<p>She opened the door to her empty room, weeks from being occupied by anyone but her. Nobody else was on her floor. It was just Su, and 150 pounds of the life she’d just left behind in China.</p>

			<p>She hadn’t had room to bring sheets or pillows, and it was too late for buses to be running or stores to be open.</p>

			<p>Her first night in Bloomington, Su slept on her bare mattress, under her warmest winter coat.</p>
		
			<p>***</p>


			<p>IU’s integration problem starts before Chinese students even set foot in Bloomington – Jeff Holdeman is sure of it.</p>

			<p>Routine admittance emails that the university sends out are uniform across the board, and there isn’t any room for change, Holdeman, the director of the Global Village Living-Learning Center at Foster Quad, says. He’s tried to pitch the idea of sending an additional email to international students following their admittance to IU, to detail international housing options and other opportunities that could facilitate integration into American culture.</p>

			<p>But it was shut down by the administration, Holdeman says. They insisted that IU needed to stay with their brand: the same emails go to everyone.</p>

			<p>While Su chose Foster Shea because it was a half-international, half-American dorm, not all Chinese students realize that there are housing options that cater specifically to them until further along in the housing process, at which point it may be too late to join those communities.</p>

			<p>International students also often have to wait several months for their travel Visas to arrive, and many aren’t willing to put down the hefty housing deposit without the confirmation that they can study stateside, Holdeman says. Because of this, many students aren’t able to complete the housing process until June or July, and get stuck in left over spots, including overflow housing.</p>

			<p>Their first impression of IU might be living in a cramped converted lounge area with three other people.</p>

			<p>Melanie Payne, the senior associate director at First Year Experiences, knows that the introduction of international students to IU’s campus isn’t perfect.</p>

			<p>Payne recognizes that international orientation, which takes place weeks before domestic students move into their dorms, isn’t ideal in many ways.</p>

			<p>While IU does a lot right, including a new online component that prepares students paperwork-wise and with cultural tips prior to their arrival, much of the process is tedious. The legal forms and Visa paperwork, the new phone cards and work permit policies, they drag throughout the typical four days of orientation. Lectures on acclimation and culture are drawn-out: how to stay in good status to remain in the U.S., what to expect in an American college classroom, whether or not their visas cover being about to work overseas. Campus events are planned for every night of the week, but no one is coming. The lack of local students on campus creates an automatic barrier between the groups, since the international students’ first friends are other international students.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7 body-copy">
			<p>Su wishes that more domestic students had been involved in her transition from the start. Maybe with some more interaction, she wouldn’t still be struggling as much with English. She might be speaking the language outside of her classes, or her English conversation group on Fridays through Cru.</p>

			<p>Still, orientation is always evolving to become more painless for these new students, Payne says.</p>

			<p>An obvious solution, Payne says, is to bring in American students at the same time as international orientation, and bring together the groups with one central orientation process. But then, she says, American students are on campus for two weeks before Welcome Week, and it’s not as if international orientation can be pushed further toward the start of school.</p>

			<p>“It’s not like they [international students] can come for two days and then turn around and go back,” she says. </p>

			<p>Discussion groups and panels at the Office of International Services are trying to constantly smoothe out the process of acculturation and acclimation for international students, Payne says.</p>

			<p>But right now, there’s only so much they can do.</p>

		<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>u awoke August 22 to voices — voices that were too close, too loud — and strangers in her bedroom. Students had begun filtering into the dorms, and suddenly, that Saturday morning, she had a roommate.</p>

		<p>Ayana, or Yanni, Stagg came from New Albany with her dad, who helped unload a car full of college essentials into her room. It took the pair just half an hour.

		<p>Yanni, a sophomore, reassured Su that her English wasn’t as bad as Su thought it was. Su gathered up the courage to ask Yanni if she could share the mini-fridge she brought.</p>

		<p>Su’s half of the room is blank; the white walls are untouched, her wooden desktop is sparsely decorated. Next to her bed is a short bookshelf that doubles as a nightstand, where she keeps her stash of traditional Chinese milk tea and a glass jar of dried flowers.</p>

		<p>The most colorful of Su’s decorations is on her door: four printed powerpoint slides of information about her. Everyone on the floor had to do it, she says, to get to know each other better.</p>

		<p>On one page she poses in pictures, side by side, of herself with her mother, who smiles, and her father, whose face is stoic. “Lovely mummy, handsome daddy,” she captioned the photos.</p>

		<p>Soon after her first day of classes — she was late for calculus but liked music theory — Su missed the first holiday back home: China’s mid-autumn festival.</p>
		
		<p>She was hit hard with homesickness when she FaceTimed her parents, who were sitting around a table with her grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousins. She eyed the spread of bouilli and mooncakes with envy.</p>

		<p>Su Li’s first friends in Bloomington were other Chinese students, because that’s just how international orientation worked. On campus weeks earlier than domestic students, international students seek comfort in each other’s familiarity and clump into groups early, creating bonds that may be inseparable for years, Holdeman says. It fast-forwards the process of self-segregation, with Chinese students opting to create small, comfortable groups that naturally drift apart from other cultural clusters on campus.</p>

		<p>It was harder for Su to make American friends, especially at the beginning of the year, she said. But an inexplicable familiarity and bond exists between international students of the same race.</p>

		<p>“In America, when I see Chinese people, we’ve already become friends,” she said.

		<p>While domestic students are provided temporary housing in the Union Street apartments for their two-day orientation, international students are moved into their housing assignments for the academic year straight away.</p>

		<p>While the model is meant to ease the transition for students who are already making a big move, the result is empty dorms and lonely students.</p>

		<p>A student in the Global Village approached Holdeman one day, visibly shaking.</p>

		<p>“It’s scary here at night,” she confessed to him.</p>

		<p>For weeks, Su said, it was so quiet in her hallway, she could hear her own footsteps against the carpet.</p> 

		<p>***</p>

		<p>Su is almost late.</p> 

		<p>She eases open the heavy door of room 294 seconds before the clock reads 10:10 a.m., and she’s the last one in on time. She’s often like that, just on time.</p>

		<p>The room in the Jacobs school is nothing like the grand exterior of the school; it’s skinny and small, with creaky desks and a dusty chalkboard. The teacher scratches lines of triad chords with white chalk — a quiz.</p>

		<p>Su slips into a chair between two other international students in the class. She doesn’t bother to take off her jacket. She’s not used to cold like this; it’s early October and the Indiana air has finally slipped below 65 degrees. Suqian is warm most of the year, and Su’s only seen snow twice in her life.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7 body-copy">
		<p>She wonders when the first snow will fall in Bloomington this year.</p>

		<p>Her purple mechanical pencil is the only one that moves across her notebook during the lecture. She is the only one to follow along in her course packet, which she pulls from her bag a few minutes into the professor’s spiel on C major. </p>

		<p>She understands maybe 80 percent of the English she hears, she says, but when someone is speaking quickly, it’s easy to get lost. She made friends in Foster who have helped her practice, and her Cru conversation group helps. Still, lecture halls can be a nightmare for learning. Teachers don’t always understand that it’s difficult to be learning English and their course subject at the same time.</p>

		<p>Su studied English for three years at her school in China, but she studied to take written exams, not oral ones. They practiced grammar instead of pronunciation and spelling instead of conversation. </p>

		<p>“When I speak a lot of English, I start to get a little dizzy,” she says. The constant mental translations are exhausting.</p>

		<p>The language barrier is the most commonly stated issue for Chinese students trying to integrate into American culture. Even with passing TOEFL scores and American classmates and roommates, there still seems to be a gap in understanding that’s too large to ignore. </p>

		<p>That’s when it’s an obvious problem, Holdeman says. There are language learning groups available through Second Language Studies, and an English conversation partner program that runs through the Office of International Services. Domestic students even volunteer their time to help international students through university clubs and support systems.</p>

		<p>But international students don’t show up.</p>

		<p>“Maybe they think I don’t speak their English,” she guesses, leaning back against a couch in the Global Village’s central lounge.</p>

		<p>When Lillian arrived at IU, culture shock hit her hard. She missed her traditional food, which she couldn’t make the same here. She wasn’t used to participating in classes, having grown up in a lecture-oriented environment where students oftentimes weren’t allowed to speak.</p>

		<p>Her manners, she said, needed adjusting.</p>

		<p>“When I came here, I’m afraid people thought I was rude,” she said. She got used to more thank-yous and excuse mes and pleases. The question “how are you” was received so differently in China that when she was asked, she’d think so hard about how to respond that the person talking to her would walk away.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7 body-copy">
		<p>It’s year two for Lillian on this floor, she says, because here, people will talk to her. They’re open, interested in her culture, teach her things about theirs. They didn’t judge her for using the communal rice cooker almost every night, didn’t make comments or faces about what she liked to eat and stayed up with her to watch Marvel movies.</p>

		<p>She found her niche for living, but classes aren’t as easy. </p>

		<p>An accounting major, Lillian is in and out of the Kelley school daily. Group members ignore her, she says, laughing weakly about the difficulty but visibly turning inward. </p>

		<p>One business presentation had her four-person group split in half: two Chinese girls and two American boys. The Americans goofed off in the small group, she said, disregarding the girls’ opinions and opting to do their own work in lieu of building a team. At some point, Lillian had to ignore them and get her portion of the project done on her own. </p>

		<p>“But they were really good presenters, so I think they got a better grade than me,” she said.</p>

		<p>And it’s not as if professors don’t recognize the dissonance, she says — they do. They just don’t touch the subject.</p>

		<p>Emily Parrish, a senior who came to IU with no interest in international advocacy and will be graduating with months of living in China under her belt, says she understands the American perception of Chinese students, though it’s hard to justify.</p>

		<p>“I think the easy thing is to believe the stereotypes are true,” she says. Coming from a small town, like many domestic students do, she hadn’t even interacted with someone from a different country before college. The most diversity she’d been exposed to was the two adopted black kids at her high school.</p>

		<p>She was intimidated when she heard more Mandarin than English in an 8 a.m. physics class, and bulked at the idea of going to a “Bridges” meeting, which was an international conversation group facilitated by the campus branch of Cru. </p>

		<p>“I didn’t think it was my thing,” she said. “I’m American. But strangely, I felt at home there for the first time at IU.”</p>

		<p>It’s easier to talk to international students, she says. There’s less judgement, and she feels up-to-date on American pop culture, which isn’t a strong suit for her. Nobody is looking her up and down, studying her outfit choice. She could be silly. She started to learn Mandarin, and experience the difficulty of approaching native speakers the same way they approach her.</p>

		<p>It’s one of the most important lessons you can learn at college, she says.</p>

		<p>She emphasizes each word of what she says next.</p>

		<p>“America is not the only place on Earth.” </p>

		<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>u has a performance tomorrow, but she doesn’t know what she’s singing yet.</p>

		<p>The Chinese Student Union, also known as IUCSSA, is hosting a singing competition, and only twelve of possibly hundreds of students will be able to move to the next rounds. </p>

		<p>She can’t decide — Chinese or English? A pop song or a sappy ballad? The choices are innumerable, so she does what she knows best: karaoke with her friends on a Saturday night.</p>

		<p>Walking across campus and through downtown, Su and her friends Xu and Wenzhuo are quickly confused. Xu speaks into her phone in Chinese, and the phone spits directions back at her, but they’re lost in the dark at 9 p.m. </p>

		<p>They pass a group of drunk college men, one of whom fakes an asthma attack and demands help from them.</p> 

		<p>“Do any of you have an inhaler? Can you do CPR?”</p>

		<p>All three girls look away shyly. They pass the plethora of neon signs lighting up on Kirkwood, American students already starting to filter into the local bars.</p>

		<p>“Bloomington has so many corners,” Xu says, stopped in a parking lot on the corner of 4th and Washington. A friend finds them and leads them up the street and down a flight of stairs beneath the Lotus Garden Chinese restaurant.</p>

		<p>Bright yellow walls give way to a furnished basement with several doors lining the walls of a narrow hallway. Several feet ahead, college-aged Chinese men stand, smoking and laughing in their own language. Su and her friends are ushered into room “B.”</p>

		<p>Room B is all black and white — the fake leather couch, the flat screen TV, the striped walls — except for a lone picture of Marilyn Monroe that hangs on the wall, her lips bright red.</p>

		<p>Su croons Chinese love songs in a delicate soprano and, smiling, belts out “You Belong with Me” by Taylor Swift. It’s Lady Gaga, though, that dominates her energy.</p>

		<p>As the opening chords for the pop star’s “You and I” fill the room, Su is already tapping her black Nikes to the heavy beat.</p> 

		<p>This is her ideal weekend.</p>

		<p>She inhales, stares at the English words on the screen, and makes eye contact with the idol who made her love music.</p>

		<p>What IU needs is teeth behind ethnic shaming, Holdeman says.</p>

		<p>There’s a lot that the university does right, and the administrative movements — the external factors to international students’ moves — can only reach so far. The resources are one thing, the social aspects another completely.</p>

		<p>He’s tried to create a handbook for residential assistants to guide them in their interactions with different cultures, but RPS didn’t allow it. </p>

		<p>IU’s multicultural campus does help, he says. It’s the diverse students and faculty, the kids who come from big cities and know what it’s like to be around people who are different from themselves.</p>

		<p>“When you walk on campus and see other people like you, that creates a welcoming environment,” he says.</p>

		<p>Maybe they won’t miss home as much as they think they will. Maybe it will be easy to make American friends, and to do well in classes.</p>

		<p>Maybe it won’t be so hard.</p>

		<p>“You think,” Holdeman says, “‘Maybe I can pass here.’”</p>

		<p>Su’s actions are routine as she packs for Thanksgiving break.</p>

		<p>Out comes her big, blue suitcase. In go the most important fragments of her life.</p>

		<p>She wheels her possessions across the street to McNutt Quad at 7 p.m. the Friday before her week off, to wait for the airport shuttle with other students who are displaced for the holidays.</p>

		<p>A cluster of people await the same GO Express Travel bus, a handful of them international like herself. Their parents won’t be waiting outside their dorms Saturday morning to take them home, like Su’s floormates’ parents would be.</p>

		<p>She stands with her friends from high school, who are going to Florida with her for the week. Disneyworld is the plan, and Universal Studios if there’s time.</p>

		<p>Daylight savings meant the evening sky was already dark and the Bloomington air cool.</p>

		<p>Su reviews her journey: Shuttle to Indianapolis, Greyhound to Chicago, plane to Orlando.</p>

		<p>When the bus pulls up at 7:15, its glass windows are glossy.</p>

		<p>There’s Su in the reflection, holding her suitcase.</p>

		<p>There she is, leaving again.</p>
